## Installation

```bash
npm install --save use-shopping-cart

or

yarn add use-shopping-cart
```

The package needs to be configured with your account's publishable key, which is available in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys). Require it with the key's value.

At the root level of your app, wrap your root component in the `<CartProvider />`

```jsx
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import { CartProvider } from 'use-shopping-cart/react'

import App from './App'

ReactDOM.render(
  <CartProvider
    mode="payment"
    cartMode="checkout-session"
    stripe={YOUR_STRIPE_API_PUBLISHABLE_KEY_GOES_HERE}
    currency="USD"
  >
    <App />
  </CartProvider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
)
```

## Using the hook

The hook `useShoppingCart()` provides several utilities and pieces of data for you to use in your application. The examples below won't cover every part of the `useShoppingCart()` API but you can [look at the API](#API) below.

### Serverless implementation

If you're data source isn't coming from Stripe's dashboard, you can still make products and process payments.

You're product data should look like this:

```js
const productData = [
  {
    name: 'Bananas',
    id: 'some_unique_id_1',
    price: 400,
    image: 'https://www.fillmurray.com/300/300',
    currency: 'USD'
    product_data: {
      metadata: {
        type: 'fruit'
      }
    },
    price_data: {
      recurring: {
        interval: 'week'
      }
    }
  },
  {
    name: 'Tangerines',
    id: 'some_unique_id_2',
    price: 100,
    image: 'https://www.fillmurray.com/300/300',
    currency: 'USD',
    product_data: {
      metadata: {
        type: 'fruit'
      }
    },
    price_data: {
      recurring: {
        interval: 'week'
      }
    }
  }
]
```

_NOTE_: `price_data` and `product_data` are not required for use-shopping-cart to work, but they are required for creating Sessions with Stripe.

This library manages `price_data` and `product_data` for you, but if you need to pass extra data to your Sessions, you can add them directly to your
product objects.

Also keep in mind that `product_data` is a child of `price_data` when being sent to Stripe, but you don't need to nest for use-shopping-cart. Learn more about
creating Sessions here: https://stripe.com/docs/api/checkout/sessions/create

Once you have successfully installed `stripe`, `use-shopping-cart`, and wrapped your root component with `<CartProvider>`, you are ready to go! ðŸš€

### Netlify Functions

Create a functions directory in your project. Create a file called `create-session.js`

_Note_: You should have a way to reference products from a backend. In this small example we're just referencing from a JSON file.

```js
const stripe = require('stripe')(process.env.REACT_APP_STRIPE_API_SECRET)
const validateCartItems =
  require('use-shopping-cart/utilities').validateCartItems

const inventory = require('./data/products.json')

exports.handler = async (event) => {
  let product
  try {
    product = JSON.parse(event.body)
  } catch (error) {
    return {
      statusCode: 400,
      body: JSON.stringify({
        message: 'Received malformed JSON.',
        error: error.message
      })
    }
  }

  let line_items
  try {
    line_items = validateCartItems(inventory, product)
  } catch (error) {
    return {
      statusCode: 422,
      body: JSON.stringify({
        message: 'Some of the items in your cart are invalid.',
        error: error.message
      })
    }
  }

  let session
  try {
    session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
      payment_method_types: ['card'],
      billing_address_collection: 'auto',
      shipping_address_collection: {
        allowed_countries: ['US', 'CA']
      },
      mode: 'payment',
      success_url: `${process.env.URL}/success.html`,
      cancel_url: process.env.URL,
      line_items
    })
  } catch (error) {
    return {
      statusCode: 500,
      body: JSON.stringify({
        message: 'While communicating with Stripe, we encountered an error.',
        error: error.message
      })
    }
  }

  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: JSON.stringify({ sessionId: session.id })
  }
}
```

Alternatively, you could use the `session.url` value to take users to checkout without needing `redirectToCheckout` on the client side.

```js
return {
  statusCode: 302,
  headers: {
    Location: session.url
  },
  body: ''
}
```
