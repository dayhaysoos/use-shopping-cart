There are two ways you can implement this library. Client Only mode and Checkout Session mode

## Client Only Mode

This is for anyone who wants to make their products on the Stripe dashboard and doesn't want to manage their
own server. This is a secure, easy way to get up and running.

## Checkout Session mode

This is for any implementation that leverages Servers or a Serverless architecture. It's more work but gives you more
control over the products and prices in ways you might not be able to with Stripe's dashboard.
