## Installation

```bash
npm install --save use-shopping-cart

or

yarn add use-shopping-cart
```

The package needs to be configured with your account's publishable key, which is available in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys). Require it with the key's value.

At the root level of your app, wrap your root component in the `<CartProvider />`

```jsx
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import { CartProvider } from 'use-shopping-cart'

import App from './App'

ReactDOM.render(
  <CartProvider
    mode="payment"
    cartMode="client-only"
    stripe={YOUR_STRIPE_API_KEY_GOES_HERE}
    successUrl="stripe.com"
    cancelUrl="twitter.com/dayhaysoos"
    currency="USD"
    allowedCountries={['US', 'GB', 'CA']}
    billingAddressCollection={true}
  >
    <App />
  </CartProvider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
)
```

### Note: `mode` refers to Stripe's payment modes. Refer to the link below:

https://stripe.com/docs/api/checkout/sessions/object#checkout_session_object-mode

## Using the hook

The hook `useShoppingCart()` provides several utilities and pieces of data for you to use in your application. The examples below won't cover every part of the `useShoppingCart()` API but you can explore the documentation to find out more.

### Products Created on Stripe's Dashboard

To use client only mode, you'll need to add some products on the Stripe Dashboard. Check out [Stripe's documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/products-prices/manage-prices) for more information on how to do this.

Stripe provides you with a Price ID String. You don't need a server(less)
set up to use this library this way unless you want more control over how the payments are handled.

```jsx
import { useShoppingCart } from 'use-shopping-cart'
import { Product } from './Product'
import { CartItems } from './CartItems'

const productData = [
  {
    name: 'Bananas',
    price_id: 'price_GBJ2Ep8246qeeT',
    // price in smallest currency unit (e.g. cent for USD)
    price: 400,
    image: 'https://www.fillmurray.com/300/300',
    currency: 'USD'
  },
  {
    name: 'Tangerines',
    price_id: 'price_GBJ2WWfMaGNC2Z',
    // price in smallest currency unit (e.g. cent for USD)
    price: 100,
    image: 'https://www.fillmurray.com/300/300',
    currency: 'USD'
  }
]

export function App() {
  /* Gets the totalPrice and a method for redirecting to Stripe */
  const { totalPrice, redirectToCheckout, cartCount } = useShoppingCart()

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Renders the products */}
      {productData.map((product) => (
        <Product product={product} />
      ))}

      {/* This is where we'll render our cart */}
      <p>Number of Items: {cartCount}</p>
      <p>Total: {totalPrice}</p>
      <CartItems />

      {/* Redirects the user to Stripe */}
      <button onClick={redirectToCheckout}>Checkout</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```
