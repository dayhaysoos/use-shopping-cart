This is a function used to aid in filtering out cart entries. The first argument is your `cartDetails` and the second is a callback that takes an individual cart entry must either return a boolean or a Promise of a boolean (i.e. `Promise<boolean>`).

This can potentially be very useful for determining which products in a user's cart are in-stock our out-of-stock and then displaying them differently based on that. Or even creating a button to remove out-of-stock items from the cart. Perhaps even to help find available discounts for the user.

```js
import { filterCart } from 'use-shopping-cart' // or
import { filterCart } from 'use-shopping-cart/core'

const inStockCart = filterCart(cartDetails, async (entry) => {
  try {
    const status = fetchProductInStock(entry.id)
    return status === 'in-stock'
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error)
    return false
  }
})
```
