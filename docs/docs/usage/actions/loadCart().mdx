`loadCart(cartDetails, shouldMerge=true)` allows you to load in a previously created cart allowing the you to persist your user's shopping session across devices when logged in. `cartDetails` is the previously created `cartDetails`. `shouldMerge` is a boolean that is by default set to `true` that will try to join the current cart's details with the one you're passing in right now. If it is set to `false` it simply replaces the current cart's details with the one you're passing in.

It is recommended to set `shouldMerge` to false to avoid accidental repeated merging.

import CartDisplayWrapper from '../../../src/components/docs/cart-display-wrapper'
import LoadCart from '../../../src/components/docs/load-cart'

<CartDisplayWrapper>
  <LoadCart />
</CartDisplayWrapper>

```jsx
import React, { useEffect } from 'react'
import { useShoppingCart } from 'use-shopping-cart'

export function App() {
  const { loadCart } = useShoppingCart()
  const user = useUser()

  // Make an API request to your backend in a useEffect() to retrieve your user's previous cart
  useEffect(() => {
    let cancelled = false
    async function handler() {
      const userCartDetails = await getData(user.id)
      if (!cancelled && userCartDetails) loadCart(userCartDetails, false)
    }

    if (user?.id) {
      handler()
      return () => {
        cancelled = true
      }
    }
  }, [user])

  return <DebugCart />
}

export default App
```

The above example is the ideal use-case for `loadCart()`.
