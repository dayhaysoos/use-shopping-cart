`validateCartItems(inventory, cartItems)`

validateCartItems checks the items in the current cart and compares them with a source of truth to
make sure that the prices and quantities are correct. This is necessary because it's possible that
malicious users could manipulate the values of prices in the DOM before sending to `redirectToCheckout`

inventory: Source of truth. This should be the object of products you sell. It can come from anywhere that
is secure. An API call, or a json file that sits on a server.

cartItems: the cartItems that comes from the `use-shopping-cart`

```jsx
const stripe = require('stripe')(process.env.REACT_APP_STRIPE_API_SECRET)
const validateCartItems = require('use-shopping-cart/src/serverUtil')
  .validateCartItems

/*
 * Product data can be loaded from anywhere. In this case, we’re loading it from
 * a local JSON file, but this could also come from an async call to your
 * inventory management service, a database query, or some other API call.
 *
 * The important thing is that the product info is loaded from somewhere trusted
 * so you know the pricing information is accurate.
 */
const inventory = require('./data/products.json')

exports.handler = async (event) => {
  try {
    const productJSON = JSON.parse(event.body)

    const line_items = validateCartItems(inventory, productJSON)

    const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
      payment_method_types: ['card'],
      billing_address_collection: 'auto',
      shipping_address_collection: {
        allowed_countries: ['US', 'CA']
      },

      /*
       * This env var is set by Netlify and inserts the live site URL. If you want

      success_url: `${process.env.URL}/success.html`,
      cancel_url: process.env.URL,
      line_items
    })

    return {
      statusCode: 200,
      body: JSON.stringify({ sessionId: session.id })
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error)
  }
}
```
