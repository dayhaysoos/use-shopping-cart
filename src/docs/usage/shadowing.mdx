## Changing the logo

If you want to change the logo just create the following file:

```js title=src/@rocketseat/gatsby-theme-docs/components/Logo.js
import styled from '@emotion/styled';

import logo from '../assets/logo.svg';

export default styled.div`
  width: 160px;
  height: 36px;
  background-size: contain;
  background: url(${logo}) center no-repeat;
`;
```

## Changing the home text

Create a file at `src/@rocketseat/gatsby-theme-docs/text/index.mdx` to edit the text.
