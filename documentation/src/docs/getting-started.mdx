## Installation

```bash
npm install --save @stripe/stripe-js use-shopping-cart

or

yarn add @stripe/stripe-js use-shopping-cart
```

The package needs to be configured with your account's secret key, which is available in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys). Require it with the key's value.

At the root level of your app, wrap your root component in the `<CartProvider />`

```jsx
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'

import { loadStripe } from '@stripe/stripe-js'
import { CartProvider } from 'use-shopping-cart'

import App from './App'

// Remember to add your public Stripe key
const stripePromise = loadStripe(process.env.REACT_APP_STRIPE_API_PUBLIC)

ReactDOM.render(
  <CartProvider
    mode="client-only"
    stripe={stripePromise}
    successUrl="stripe.com"
    cancelUrl="twitter.com/dayhaysoos"
    currency="USD"
    allowedCountries={['US', 'GB', 'CA']}
    billingAddressCollection={true}
  >
    <App />
  </CartProvider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
)
```

## Using the hook

The hook `useShoppingCart()` provides several utilities and pieces of data for you to use in your application. The examples below won't cover every part of the `useShoppingCart()` API but you can [look at the API](#API) below.

### Products Created on Stripe's Dashboard

This is for products you created on the Stripe Dashboard. Stripe provides you with a Price ID String. You don't need a server(less)
set up to use this library this way unless you want more control over how the payments are handled.

```jsx
import { useShoppingCart } from 'use-shopping-cart'
import { Product } from './Product'
import { CartItems } from './CartItems'

const productData = [
  {
    name: 'Bananas',
    price_id: 'price_GBJ2Ep8246qeeT',
    price: 400,
    image: 'https://www.fillmurray.com/300/300',
    currency: 'USD'
  },
  {
    name: 'Tangerines',
    price_id: 'price_GBJ2WWfMaGNC2Z',
    price: 100,
    image: 'https://www.fillmurray.com/300/300',
    currency: 'USD'
  }
]

export function App() {
  /* Gets the totalPrice and a method for redirecting to stripe */
  const { totalPrice, redirectToCheckout, cartCount } = useShoppingCart()

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Renders the products */}
      {productData.map((product) => (
        <Product product={product} />
      ))}

      {/* This is where we'll render our cart */}
      <p>Number of Items: {cartCount}</p>
      <p>Total: {totalPrice}</p>
      <CartItems />

      {/* Redirects the user to Stripe */}
      <button onClick={() => redirectToCheckout()}>Checkout</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Server(less) implementation

If you're data source isn't coming from Stripe's dashboard, you can still make products and make payments happen from them.

You're product data should look like this:

```jsx
const productData = [
  {
    name: 'Bananas',
    id: 'some_unique_id_1',
    price: 400,
    image: 'https://www.fillmurray.com/300/300',
    currency: 'USD'
    product_data: {
      metadata: {
        type: 'fruit'
      }
    },
    price_data: {
      recurring: {
        interval: 'week'
      }
    }
  },
  {
    name: 'Tangerines',
    id: 'some_unique_id_2',
    price: 100,
    image: 'https://www.fillmurray.com/300/300',
    currency: 'USD',
    product_data: {
      metadata: {
        type: 'fruit'
      }
    },
    price_data: {
      recurring: {
        interval: 'week'
      }
    }
  }
]
```

_NOTE_: `price_data` and `product_data` are not required for use-shopping-cart to work, but they are required for creating Sessions with Stripe.

This library manages `price_data` and `product_data` for you, but if you need to pass extra data to your Sessions, you can add them directly to your
product objects.

Also keep in mind that `product_data` is a child of `price_data` when being sent to Stripe, but you don't need to nest for use-shopping-cart. Learn more about
creating Sessions here: https://stripe.com/docs/api/checkout/sessions/create

Once you have successfully installed `stripe`, `use-shopping-cart`, and wrapped your root component with `<CartProvider>`, you are ready to go! 🚀
