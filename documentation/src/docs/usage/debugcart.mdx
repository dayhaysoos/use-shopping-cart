If you ever need to quickly see the properties and values that `useShoppingCart()` has at a given moment, you can use the `DebugCart` component. It will display a table of all of the properties — not methods — and let you log any objects to the console.

When using this component, you still must have `<CartProvider>` wrapped around your application. See [the documentation for CartProvider](/usage/cartprovider) if you don't know how to do that.

<DebugCartExample />

```jsx
import { DebugCart } from 'use-shopping-cart'

export function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <p>This is an example of what the DebugCart component looks like.</p>
      <DebugCart />
    </>
  )
}
```

Without any style modifications, `<DebugCart />` will present more like it does in the following screenshot. It uses fixed positioning by default.

![The table resides in the top right of the page via fixed positioning and there aren't any borders around the table elements.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19195374/107888790-310d2800-6ed4-11eb-9f0f-89b95631ff72.png)

## Debugging Tips

If you don't want to drop this component into your code or you're just more fond of the React DevTools extension, as of version 2.5.0 use-shopping-cart now uses React's `useDebugValue` hook to allow you to easily inspect all of the values that `useShoppingCart()` returns. In order to find the debug value, open React DevTools and inspect a component that calls `useShoppingCart()`. Under "Hooks" you will see "ShoppingCart", if you look inside it you will find the "DebugValue".
