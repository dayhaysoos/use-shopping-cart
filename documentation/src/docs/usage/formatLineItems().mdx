`formatLineItems(cartDetails)` Is a function that helps with creating Session IDs server side
for products that have been created on the Stripe dashboard. It's preferred to use this with the
Price API.


It's important that your product data has a `price_id` key that provides the given Price ID you get
from Stripe's dashboard.
